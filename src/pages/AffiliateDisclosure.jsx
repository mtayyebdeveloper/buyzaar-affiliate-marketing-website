        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Buyzaar contains affiliate links to products and services that we believe are valuable to our readers. When you click on one of these links and make a purchase, we may receive a commission from the retailer or service provider.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Please note that we only recommend products and services that we trust, based on our own research or personal experience. Our recommendations are independent and are not influenced by the commissions we may earn.
